# SharePoint Online Document Library Automation

## Overview

This PowerShell script automates the creation of a **SharePoint Online Document Library**, generates a **hierarchical folder structure**, and uploads **PDF files** from a local directory.

## Features

- ‚úÖ **Creates a Document Library** in SharePoint (if not already present).
- ‚úÖ **Adds custom columns** (`FolderCount`, `PageCount`).
- ‚úÖ **Renames the 'Title' column** to 'Name'.
- ‚úÖ **Recursively creates folders** in SharePoint to match the local folder structure.
- ‚úÖ **Uploads PDF files** inside their respective SharePoint folders.

## Prerequisites

### 1. Install PnP PowerShell

If not already installed, run the following command in PowerShell:

```powershell
Install-Module -Name PnP.PowerShell -Scope CurrentUser -Force
```

### 2. Set Execution Policy (if restricted)

Enable running PowerShell scripts using:

```powershell
Set-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope CurrentUser
```

### 3. Required Permissions

Ensure you have **Admin or Owner access** to the SharePoint site.

## Configuration

Before running the script, update the following variables in the script:

```powershell
$siteUrl = "https://yourtenant.sharepoint.com/sites/YourSite"
$libraryName = "YourLibraryName"
$libraryDisplayName = "Your Library Display Name"
$localPath = "C:\Your\Local\Path"
```

Ensure that `$localPath` is correctly set to your **local folder path** containing the files.

## Usage

### 1. Open PowerShell as Administrator.

### 2. Run the script:

```powershell
.\YourScriptName.ps1
```

### 3. Authenticate with SharePoint.

The script will:

- Connect to SharePoint.
- Create the document library (if missing).
- Add required columns and rename the Title field.
- Create the entire folder structure.
- Upload all PDF files to their respective folders.

## Expected Output

The script will display logs similar to this:

```
